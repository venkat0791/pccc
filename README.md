# Parallel-concatenated convolutional code (PCCC)

This crate implements encoding and decoding functionality for a _parallel-concatenated
convolutional code_ (PCCC), commonly referred to as a
[turbo code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_code). An instance of such a code is
used for forward error correction in the 4G LTE standard for wireless broadband communication
(see [3GPP TS 36.212](https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/36_series/36.212/)).

See the [API documentation](https://docs.rs/pccc) for more details and illustrative examples.
